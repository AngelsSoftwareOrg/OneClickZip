A GUI application that will let you able to design your own Zip Files individually or filter/dynamic base contents.

After you design your own Zip Files content, you can make a shortcut of your design project that will let you execute it anywhere to launch the program that directly proceed zipping your designed Zip Files Content. It will by pass the Designer GUI and proceed automating your Zip Files content.

# Features
 At the surface, this program is like the major Zip File utility programs. 
 You create folders and place files on it. 
 As you place your folders and files on it, it is already zipped on the fly.
 To compare, this program will let you design first your Zip File structures before committing to Zip It. 
  
  Here are the following features this program offers 
  
 **1. Dynamic Zip File Name.**
 - Useful to prevent overwriting the same zip file if you want to maintain a series of backup
 
 **2. Dynamic Zip Folder Content**
 - If your target folder ever increasing on files, you can filter out which of which will be included on the final Zip File.
 - It is capable of including sub folder from the target folder
 - It will let you filter the files including sub directories files using GLOB like syntax
 - It will let you filter the files base on its size and date
 - For dynamic folders, It will let you exclude those folder that doesn't contains any files on it. Typical Zip Utility will include all sub folders regardless of what it contains or just an empty folder. 
 
 **3. Rename added files before putting on the Zipped File**
 - You can rename the original folders and files you selected before putting it on the Zip File 
 
 **4. Create a "One Click Zip" short cut file, to perform zipping your designed folders and files on fly.**
- A very handy feature that will perform Zipping your designed zip file structure anywhere

 **5. Place your Zip File in your target folder .**
 - Zipping your zip file structure will place the output Zip File into your own choice of folder. This feature will let you organize your files base of your categorization of its content.

## When to use this tool?

Wondering when to use this tool to take it advantages?
Here are some of the scenario's I think where it can be useful...


1. Gaming Save file backup
- Im using the tool [GameSave Manager](https://www.gamesave-manager.com/) to make a backup of the games save files I've played.
- If you ever had an increasing files count of your gaming save backup, you can make a dynamic folder filter on it and make a Zip File out of it.
- You may ever think you can right click on the backup folder and zip it? Mind not, because, this tool also offer to let you include only those files like 
(example given out base on the tool capability)

-- Files recently created within 7 days

-- Files which had an actual game save, usually file size exceed let's say 100 bytes

2. I'm using this tool to manage my backup of my Password Utility Program called [Keepass Password Safe](https://keepass.info/). Using the Major Zip Utility program, I can make a zip backup of my password manager database. However, I need to do a follow up actions after zipping it:
- Rename the file uniquely
- Maintains several copies of the back up for historical reason. (There are times you can't quite remember what you did and some entries are missing. You can track the missing entries on those historical backups)
- Place this backup to Cloud sync folder, to solidify my backup routine.

3. Same reason with #2, I'm using this tool to make a backup of my accounting database. I'm using the Utility Program called [GNU Cash Org](https://www.gnucash.org/)

4. If you had a meme collections and you are loving it so much, and you want your copies to have a back up, using this tool, you may opt to do the following.
- Zip up normally the current Meme collection folder as your snapshot backup.
- Create a new Zip File Designs. This will target the new files going into your collections.
- In the Project Zip Designer, add a Dynamic Folder, and filter only those files are recently added in your collections. Let say, files that are recently written within a day, within 7 days, a week or a month. 
- Place your target folder to place the Zip File Output
- Create a One Click Zip shortcut
- You may run/execute the shortcut everyday, or every week, depending on your intent.


As times goes by, people are creative enough to create new memes, and you don't have a good excuse not to love it, thus your collections increases, and the need to back those up will prompt you to do something about it, thus this tool was for you.

4. Improve the operation and process of saving the designer and one click batch
